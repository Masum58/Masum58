Masum Abedin

AI Systems Engineer focused on designing and building production-grade intelligent systems.

I specialize in end-to-end AI architecture — from data processing and model development to scalable backend APIs and deployment. My work centers on solving real business problems using machine learning, LLM-driven systems, and robust infrastructure design.

I approach AI not as isolated models, but as complete, maintainable systems built for scale.
